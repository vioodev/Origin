# Origin

A Bukkit server core plugin which is currently under construction.
This is a project I made to boost my portfolio and not even close to be finished.

You may use the plugin/source for private purposes if you want to, but please keep in mind that the plugin was never meant to actually make public use of and I wouldn't recommend using it on a professional server.

Again, this project is still in development and unfinished - I'll try to push updates regularly.

### Features
- Inventory menu framework
- Command framework
- Ranks & punishments
- Common utility classes

Some of that stuff is still unfinished and more features will be added.

### Information
- Lombok is used to avoid the code from being messed up due to too many getters and setters
- Database: MongoDB - I usually make use of SQL so I was kinda new to it
- Documentation is retarded but idiot-proof
